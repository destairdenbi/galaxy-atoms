single-end NGS reads.<br>
Quality control analysis provides an overview of the sequence quality, as well
as a mean to identify low quality score sequence content. Once done, we will
remove those low quality score sequences which might ultimately bias the
interpretation of results.<br>
Here, we will leverage on two tools:<br>
- <b>FastQC</b>, to assess the quality of the sequences<br>
- <b>PRINSEQ</b>, to remove low quality sequence content.'

quality scores of all reads.<br>
The Y axis shows the quality score: the higher, the better the base call.
The background color of the graph divides the base call operation into:<br>
- Very good quality (green)<br>
- Reasonable quality (orange)<br>
- Poor quality (red).<br>
The quality of each call usually degrades as the sequencing run progresses.
Here however, each provided input dataset shows lower average quality scores at
the beginning of each sequence. Although these scores still account for
reasonable quality reads, a reason behind this trend might be that the image
scanner focus had to be recalibrated during the first sequence run cycles.<br>
